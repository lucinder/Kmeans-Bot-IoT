# KMeans-Bot-IoT
Implementation of [AML lecture 9/10 KMeans Clustering](https://github.com/alegaballo/AML/blob/master/%5BLecture%209%2B10%5D%20Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Network%20Traffic%20with%20K-means%20clustering.ipynb) (Q's 2-12) for the [Bot-IoT](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset) dataset (best features/5% dataset sample).

Rewritten to NOT require pyspark (because it doesn't work on my computer, womp womp).

(I forgot to include the warnings ignore at the top, but whatever).
